# Project-For-Fraud-Detection

Certainly! Here’s an explanation of each column in your dataset to help you understand what they represent and how they relate to fraud detection:

1. **`step`**: 
   - This column represents the unit of time when each transaction occurred. Here, each step is equivalent to 1 hour, so a value of `1` means the transaction happened in the first hour, `2` in the second hour, and so on. 
   - Since your dataset covers 744 steps, it simulates 30 days of transaction data.

2. **`type`**: 
   - Indicates the type of transaction. Common transaction types are:
     - **CASH-IN**: Depositing money into an account.
     - **CASH-OUT**: Withdrawing money from an account.
     - **DEBIT**: A direct withdrawal (often automatic) from an account, such as a bill payment.
     - **PAYMENT**: Payments made to merchants or for services.
     - **TRANSFER**: Transferring funds between accounts.
   - Some types (especially `TRANSFER` and `CASH-OUT`) are often linked to fraudulent activities in this dataset.

3. **`amount`**: 
   - This is the amount of money transferred in the transaction, in local currency. Larger transaction amounts, especially in `TRANSFER` and `CASH-OUT` transactions, can be red flags in fraud detection.

4. **`nameOrig`**: 
   - Refers to the ID of the account that initiated the transaction (the origin). The naming convention here (like "C429214117") is a unique identifier for each customer or account making the transaction.

5. **`oldbalanceOrg`**: 
   - The account balance of `nameOrig` **before** the transaction occurred. This value helps to track how much money the customer had before the transaction.

6. **`newbalanceOrig`**: 
   - The account balance of `nameOrig` **after** the transaction was completed. Comparing this with `oldbalanceOrg` and the transaction `amount` helps to verify the transaction’s legitimacy. For instance, in fraud cases, the balance changes might not align correctly with the transaction amount.

7. **`nameDest`**: 
   - The ID of the destination account (the recipient). Names starting with "M" indicate merchants, while others represent customer accounts. If the recipient is a merchant, it usually means the money is going toward a purchase or service payment.

8. **`oldbalanceDest`**: 
   - The balance of the destination account (`nameDest`) **before** the transaction. In some cases, this value might be `0`, particularly when the recipient is a merchant, as merchant account balances may not be tracked the same way.

9. **`newbalanceDest`**: 
   - The balance of the destination account (`nameDest`) **after** the transaction. Like `oldbalanceDest`, this might also be `0` for merchants. This field helps to confirm whether the amount transferred was accurately reflected in the recipient’s balance.

10. **`isFraud`**: 
    - This is the **target** column for fraud detection. A value of `1` indicates that the transaction is **fraudulent**, and `0` means it is **not fraudulent**. Fraudulent transactions in this dataset simulate scenarios where an account is controlled by a fraudster attempting to empty funds, typically by `TRANSFER` or `CASH-OUT`.

11. **`isFlaggedFraud`**: 
    - This column indicates whether the system has flagged a transaction as suspicious due to a specific rule. Here, any `TRANSFER` that moves more than `200,000` in one transaction is flagged (`1` means flagged, `0` means not flagged). This helps in capturing potentially risky transactions for review, although flagged transactions may not always be fraudulent.

These columns collectively provide the details needed to detect fraud by analyzing transaction patterns, unusual balance changes, and transaction types and amounts, particularly with focus on `isFraud` and `isFlaggedFraud`. This structure lets us identify suspicious transactions, build detection strategies, and assess risks in the banking environment.
